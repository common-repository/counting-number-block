This block provides an animated counter effect for numbers. Itâ€™s fast, lightweight, SEO-friendly, accessibility-ready, and fits any design.

== Description ==

This single-block plugin makes your numbers stand out by animating them while still keeping them SEO-friendly, accessibility-ready, and respecting the reduced motion mode. The number can be counted up or down.

This block performs one simple job: animating numbers. You can combine it with other blocks to fit any design.

=== Key features ===

* It can be counted up or down depending on the start value and the real value
* SEO and Accessibility ready - Screen readers will read the actual number value, not the animated one.
* It can be fit in any design
* Highly customizable with a large range of options like duration, separator, decimal, etc.
* You can animate it one time or multiple times whenever the block appears in the viewport
* You can provide a prefix and/or a suffix value
* The animated effect will not be shown in the reduced motion mode
